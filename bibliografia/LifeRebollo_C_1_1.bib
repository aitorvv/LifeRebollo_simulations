	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Close to nature silviculture is an alternative to a forest management system based on the clear cutting regeneration and cultivation of even-aged coniferous monocultures. The history of close to nature silviculture dates back to the second half of the 19th century, when the first attempts were made in Central Europe for more sophisticated silvicultural practices based on natural small-scale regeneration and management of mixed stands. These activities also affected the Czech lands, where the ideas of close to nature silviculture were successfully developed by the end of the 1960s. For the next twenty years, however, under the influence of central planning, forest management has been inclined towards large-scale clear cutting system. The renaissance of close to nature forest management took place only after 1989. At present, close to nature silviculture being established not only in Central Europe, but also more and more in the boreal part of Europe as well as in North America. Currently, there is a discussion about suitability of close-to-nature silviculture for adapting temperate forests to climate change.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Adapting forests to climate change is a critical issue for forest management. It requires an understanding of climate effects on forest systems and the ability to forecast how these effects may change over time. We used Spanish Second National Forest Inventory data and the SIMANFOR platform to simulate the evolution of CO $_{\textrm{2}}$ stock (CO $_{\textrm{2}}$ Mg · ha $^{\textrm{−1}}$ ) and accumulation rates (CO $_{\textrm{2}}$ Mg · ha $^{\textrm{−1}}$ · year $^{\textrm{−1}}$ ) for the 2000–2100 period in pure and mixed stands managed under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) in Spain. We hypothesized that (1) the more optimistic climate scenarios (SSP1 \&gt;  \&gt; SSP5) would have higher CO $_{\textrm{2}}$ stock and accumulation rates; (2) mixed stands would have higher CO $_{\textrm{2}}$ stock and accumulation rates than pure stands; and (3) the behavior of both variables would vary based on forest composition (conifer–conifer vs. conifer–broadleaf). We focused on {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Pinus sylvestris{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} L., and its main mixtures with {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Pinus nigra{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} , {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Pinus pinaster{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} , {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Fagus sylvatica{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Quercus pyrenaica{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} . The SSP scenarios had correlating CO $_{\textrm{2}}$ stock values in which SSP1 \&gt; SSP2 \&gt; SSP3 \&gt; SSP5, ranging from the most optimistic (SSP1) to the most pessimistic (SSP5). Though pure stands had higher CO $_{\textrm{2}}$ stock at the beginning, differences with regard to mixed stands were drastically reduced at the end of the simulation period. We also found an increase in the aboveground CO $_{\textrm{2}}$ proportion compared to belowground in conifer–broadleaf mixtures, while the opposite trend occurred in conifer–conifer mixtures. Overall CO $_{\textrm{2}}$ accumulation rates decreased significantly from the beginning to the end of the simulation period, but our results indicated that this decline would be less drastic in mixed stands than in pure ones. At the end of the simulation period, CO $_{\textrm{2}}$ accumulation rates were higher in mixed stands than in pure stands for all mixtures, fractions (aboveground and belowground) and SSPs. Knowing the evolution of mixed forests in different climate scenarios is relevant for developing useful silvicultural guidelines in the Mediterranean region and optimizing forestry adaptation strategies. Better understanding can also inform the design of management measures for transitioning from pure stands to more resource efficient, resistant and resilient mixed stands, in efforts to reduce forest vulnerability in the face of climate change. This work highlights the importance and benefits of mixed stands in terms of CO $_{\textrm{2}}$ accumulation, stand productivity and species diversity. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	volume = {24},
	url = {www.simanfor.es},
	abstract = {This research was carried out in the region of Cas-tile-Leon, located in Central Spain. The region covers approximately 9.4 million ha and is one of the most important areas for timber production in Spain. Predominant oak stands cover more than half of the area, while pine stands cover one third of the area. Altitude fluctuates between 110 and 2650 m above sea level. The climate in Castile-Leon is both continental and Mediterranean: average winter temperatures range between 4 and 7 °C, while average summer temperatures range from 19 to 22 °C; with three or four dry summer months that are typical of a Mediterranean climate. Average annual rainfall is only 450 to 500 mm, mostly in lower altitudes. The data used in this study were collected in 242 public and private forests in Central Spain. Data from 1,844 Scots pines, 456 stone pines, 533 black pines, 1,715 Mediterranean maritime pines, 326 Spanish junipers, 302 Pyrenean oaks, 992 poplars and 189 beeches were used to test the statistical performance of the taper functions. Thus, a total of 6,357 trees were selected for destructive sampling using the protocol of Garber and Maguire (2003). The trees were felled from thinned and unthinned stands, which were subjectively selected to represent the existing range of site qualities. Before felling, two attributes were recorded for each sample tree: (i) diameter at breast height, D (to the nearest 0.1 cm); (ii) total tree height, H (to the nearest 0.01 m). Each sample tree was felled in a manner that minimized stem breakage. A tape measure was stretched along the bole and total height was recorded from the base of the stump to the top of the tree. The tree was divided into sections, and thin disks were removed for diameter measurements at the base of the stump; at 80 cm above the ground level; at breast height; and at a height midway between every other whorl pair above breast height (1-3 m intervals). For each disk, height (h, to the nearest 0.01 m) and diameter over bark (d, to the nearest 0.1 cm) were measured along two perpendicular axes. Log volumes in cubic meters were calculated using Smali-an's formula. The topmost log was considered conical in shape. Total volume (V in m 3) was obtained by summing the log volumes. Between 3 and 40 disks were cut per tree, for a total of 87,568 disks. Summary statistics including the number of observations , arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and minimum/maximum values of the main variables are presented in Table 1. merchantable volume equations derived from volume-ratio equations are very easy to use and develop, those obtained from taper functions are preferred nowadays; perhaps because they allow for estimation of diameter at a given height (Diéguez-Aranda et al., 2006). Compatibility means that an integrated model can be obtained through summation of the differential model. Thus, for a given merchantable volume equation , there is an intrinsically defined compatible taper function (Clutter, 1980). This implies that integration of the taper function from the ground to the top of the tree would provide the appropriate volume, and subsequently the merchantable volume equation (Fang et al., 2000). Existing research indicates that segmented models appear to be more accurate than other model formulations (e.g., Corral-Rivas et al., 2007) for creating compatible systems. To develop a taper function, diameter/height data pairs are required along the stem. Most taper functions can be included in the following groups: single and segmented taper models, trigonometric equations, and variable-form taper models. Stem taper functions are usually based on the diameter at breast height (dbh), and predict diameter over bark (Rojo et al., 2005; Crecente-Campo et al., 2009); though they can also predict diameter inside bark (Garber \& Maguire, 2003; Calama \& Montero, 2006) and bark thickness (Laasa-senaho et al., 2005). Forestry researchers in Spain have been developing taper equations since the 1970s. Recently, a considerable number of taper equations have been developed for particular regions and species: some for hardwoods but most for softwoods (Bravo et al., 2011). Due to their complicated formulations, most taper functions are implemented with specific software in order to estimate total and merchantable volume from inventory data (e.g. SiManFor; www.simanfor.es). In central Spain, most harvested tree species are Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Mediterranean maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyr-enaica Willd.), poplar (Populus x euramericana (Dode) Guinier), stone pine (Pinus pinea L.), Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera L.), black pine (Pinus nigra Ar-nold.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). According to the Spanish National Forest Inventory (SNFI) in Central Spain these species occupy around 1,742,975 ha, have a standing volume of approximately 113,437,012 m 3 and produce an annual harvest of about 1,274,594 m 3. The objective of this study was to compare a stem taper function and a compatible merchantable volume system to ascertain which provides a better description of the stem profile, in order to obtain accurate partial or total stem volume estimates for the main species in the Spanish plateau (central Spain).},

	abstract = {A dominant height growth model and a site index model were developed for rebollo oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) in northwest Spain. Data from147 stem analysis in 90 permanent plots, where rebollo oak was the main species, were used formodelling. The plots were selected fromthe National Forest Inventory at random in proportion to four biogeoclimatic stratums. Different traditional and generalized algebraic difference equations were tested. The evaluation criteria included qualitative and quantitative examinations and a testing with independent data from another region. The generalized algebraic difference equation of Cieszewski based on Bailey equation showed the best results for the four stratums. An analysis of the height growth patterns among ecological stratums was made in order to study the necessity of different site index curves. Results indicated the validity of a common height growth model for the four stratums. In spite of the irregular height growth pattern observed in rebollo oak, probably due to past management, the model obtained allows us to classify and compare correctly rebollo oak stands growing at different sites.},

It is derived by the interpolation of monthly climate anomalies from extensive networks of weather station observations. Here we describe the construction of a major new version, CRU TS v4. It is updated to span 1901–2018 by the inclusion of additional station observations, and it will be updated annually. The interpolation process has been changed to use angular-distance weighting (ADW), and the production of secondary variables has been revised to better suit this approach. This implementation of ADW provides improved traceability between each gridded value and the input observations, and allows more informative diagnostics that dataset users can utilise to assess how dataset quality might vary geographically.

Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

	abstract = {Accurate and representative prediction of ingrowth is essential for modeling forest development. Besides the number of ingrowth trees, the basic tree attributes diameter and species are also important. In this study, these three characteristics were modeled based on data from the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI). The study covered large gradients of stand conditions and climate variables, making the models suitable to predict ingrowth under climate change. As the number of ingrowth trees per plot included more zeros than is expected for a Poisson distribution, we used three alternative probability distributions: zero-inflated Poisson distribution (ZIP), negative binomial distribution (NB) and zero-inflated negative binomial distribution (ZINB). Models with each of the three variants were fitted with and without random effects, resulting in six different model types. Model selection was performed backward using the BIC criterion. Of the final models, ZIP showed the best predictions of independently observed number of ingrowth trees. Our results indicate that the number of ingrowth trees strongly depended on the development stage of forests and on stand basal area, while temperature and precipitation, nitrogen deposition and water holding capacity each had a lower but still significant and plausible effect. The Weibull function was used to describe the probability distribution of the diameter of ingrowth trees and parameters were estimated using the Likelihood approach. The diameter of ingrowth trees was larger where there was a better site index and decreased with increasing stand density. Further, twelve species groups of ingrowth trees were fitted with a multinomial regression approach and showed clear dependence on climate: the probability of spruce and larch ingrowth clearly decreased with increasing temperature, whilst all other tree species profited from warmer conditions. The probability of fir, beech and ash ingrowth increased with increasing basal area, demonstrating the relevance of shade tolerance. The most important variable for predicting the species of ingrowth was the leading tree species group in a plot.},

Analyzing high-resolution annual satellite-based canopy mortality maps from 1987 to 2016 we here show that excess forest mortality (i.e., canopy mortality exceeding the long-term mortality trend) is significantly related to drought across continental Europe. The relationship between water availability and mortality showed threshold behavior, with excess mortality increasing steeply when the integrated climatic water balance from March to July fell below −1.6 standard deviations of its long-term average. For −3.0 standard deviations the probability of excess canopy mortality was 91.6\% (83.8–97.5\%). Overall, drought caused approximately 500,000 ha of excess forest mortality between 1987 and 2016 in Europe. We here provide evidence that drought is an important driver of tree mortality at the continental scale, and suggest that a future increase in drought could trigger widespread tree mortality in Europe.},

It remains uncertain, however, whether tree mortality across drought-stricken landscapes will be concentrated in particular climatic and competitive environments. We investigated the effects of long-term average climate [i.e. 35-year mean annual climatic water deficit (CWD)] and competition (i.e. tree basal area) on tree mortality patterns, using extensive aerial mortality surveys conducted throughout the forests of California during a 4-year statewide extreme drought lasting from 2012 to 2015. During this period, tree mortality increased by an order of magnitude, typically from tens to hundreds of dead trees per km2, rising dramatically during the fourth year of drought. Mortality rates increased independently with average CWD and with basal area, and they increased disproportionately in areas that were both dry and dense. These results can assist forest managers and policy-makers in identifying the most drought-vulnerable forests across broad geographic areas.},

Our analyses of longitudinal data from unmanaged old forests in the western United States showed that background (noncatastrophic) mortality rates have increased rapidly in recent decades, with doubling periods ranging from 17 to 29 years among regions. Increases were also pervasive across elevations, tree sizes, dominant genera, and past fire histories. Forest density and basal area declined slightly, which suggests that increasing mortality was not caused by endogenous increases in competition. Because mortality increased in small trees, the overall increase in mortality rates cannot be attributed solely to aging of large trees. Regional warming and consequent increases in water deficits are likely contributors to the increases in tree mortality rates.},

After tracking the fates of 21 338 trees in a network of old-growth forest plots in the Sierra Nevada of California, we found that mortality rate, but not the recruitment rate, increased significantly over the 22 years of measurement (1983–2004). Mortality rates increased in both of two dominant taxonomic groups (Abies and Pinus) and in different forest types (different elevational zones). The increase in overall mortality rate resulted from an increase in tree deaths attributed to stress and biotic causes, and coincided with a temperature-driven increase in an index of drought. Our findings suggest that these forests (and by implication, other water-limited forests) may be sensitive to temperature-driven drought stress, and may be poised for die-back if future climates continue to feature rising temperatures without compensating increases in precipitation.},

	abstract = {The paper provides a conversion regime from even-aged to uneven-aged stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.). The conversion regime was tested by the distance-dependent single-tree simulator SILVA 2.1. The initial data for the simulation and the assumed site productivity were deduced using inventory data of the north Black Forest. The conversion regime was compared to a typical future-tree oriented age–class treatment system. Thereby four variants of the conversion regime, differing in the number and diameter of the ‘regeneration-funnels’ (gaps in the canopy of the stand) which were created during the ‘graded-regeneration-phase’, were compared to a basal-area oriented future-tree age–class treatment. A simulation-run of 110 years — divided into 22 periods of five years — was conducted. The analysis of the simulation-run showed that the possibilities to achieve uneven-aged structures in single-layered, even-aged stands through ‘structuring measures’ during thinning or target–diameter harvesting were very limited. The success of the conversion depended mainly on the success of the regeneration during the conversion. The early creation of ‘regeneration-funnels’ was linked to severe losses in increment and standing volume. As well as influences on different stand-parameters (e.g. stem-distribution) changes in structure-parameters caused by the conversion could be assessed. In particular, the modified Shannon-index did react distinctly to the implementation of the natural regeneration in the regeneration-funnels. Indeed, a steady state was only temporarily reached with the variant with the largest gaps. Finally, the results of the conversion experiment were subject to a critical review. Thus, the limits of the model in its current version and further research needs were discussed.},

A comparison to a ‘business as usual’ management approach (i.e. age-class scenario) was also made. Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.)-dominated forests of different ages were selected for the simulation: forest at thinning stage (52 years; hereafter, ‘younger stand’) and a mature stand (95 years) to explore different starting points for the transformation.The harvested and remaining stand volume showed only little fluctuation over the course of the simulation period in the case of the transformation (uneven-aged) scenario. The age-class scenario, on the other hand, showed peaks and drops in the timber volume.The land expectation values at the end of transformation were higher (i = 1 or 2 per cent) or equal (i = 3 per cent) to those of the age-class scenario for the younger stand. The transformation of younger forests appears to be economically interesting (under interest rates above 2 per cent) as the early revenues of more intensive thinnings achieve an equilibrium growing stock well below the potential maximum growing stock of an even-aged stand. This suggests transformation management to be economically efficient under the given silvicultural and economic conditions. The transformation of mature stands was found to be less economically viable due to the lower holding values for the transformation (uneven-aged) scenario compared with the age-class scenario. However, the holding values of the younger stand were higher for all interest rates compared with the age-class scenario.This study concludes that transformation (uneven-aged) scenario yielded more economically viable silvicultural approach (in the case of younger forests) and a steadier trend in harvested and remaining timber volume showing no major fluctuations. Transformation approach also forms a better foundation where other ecosystem services can be built.},

Also, the limited growth potential of original trees that occupied poor crown positions will force landowners to rely on the dominants and co-dominants as residual growing stock during the conversion of most even-aged stands.

This study provides a framework for simulating conversion of mature even-aged stands to uneven-aged slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) stands using the USDA Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) model. A total of 73 scenarios, representing combinations of two harvest methods (based on either “BDq” and/or “low thinning”), two harvesting cycles (10 or 20 years), three harvest intensities (4.6 or 8.0 or 11.5 m2 ha−1 residual basal areas), and six levels of regeneration (0–2,224 seedlings ha−1) were evaluated for structural diversity, timber production, and carbon (C) stocks over a 100-year period. The BDq harvest approach, which applied selection cutting based on diameter regulation from the first cutting cycle onwards, resulted in higher structural diversity. Scenarios based on low thinning in the first cutting cycle and BDq method from the third cutting cycle onwards tended to result in higher total merchantable timber and C stocks over the entire simulation period, particularly at higher residual basal areas and longer cutting cycles. None of the scenarios maximized all of the three variables simultaneously. Based on the desired objectives, land managers can choose among scenarios presented. The study revealed that regeneration and establishment of as low as 247 seedlings ha−1 can lead to successful conversion and multiple benefits from uneven-aged slash pine stands.},

Analysis was based on extensive empirical data obtained from permanent long-term experiments established in 23 even-aged and 26 uneven-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands in Southern and Central Finland. The specific goals were to determine whether there are differences in: (a) the relationship between the stocking level and the stand basal area growth, (b) the stand basal area growth rates at a given stocking level, and (c) the stand basal area growth responses to cuttings between EA and UEA stands. A model-based approach was adopted in the analysis. Modelling was used to describe general trends and patterns in the data, emphasising the effects of overall stand density, cutting intensity, and management strategy on post-treatment stand growth. A model for a stand basal-area growth was fitted as a mixed linear model to the pooled data from EA and UEA stands. Model simulations were conducted to elucidate how the treatment of stands affects the predicted stand basal area growth. The analysis revealed a clear general effect of stocking level on stand basal area growth for all data. Growth increased with increasing stocking density. There was a significant difference in the stand basal area growth of EA stands and UEA stands. The growth of UEA stands was ca. 20\% smaller than that of EA stands. There were also major differences in the timing and magnitude of the growth response to cutting between EA and UEA stands. Post treatment growth was noticeably slower in UEA stands than in EA stands, especially during the first 10 years after cutting. The results clearly show that the growth response of the trees remaining in EA stands is faster and greater than that in UEA stands, enhancing the stand basal area growth.},

It is hypothesized that the even-aged plantations have higher cubic-foot yields because they are more fully stocked with trees of merchantable size.

	abstract = {Growth and yield modeling has a long history in forestry. Methods of measuring the growth of uneven-aged forest stands have evolved from those developed in France and Switzerland during the last century. Furthermore, uneven-aged growth and yield modeling has progressed rapidly since the first models were pioneered by Moser and Hall (1969) (Moser Jr., J.W., Hall, O.F., 1969. For. Sci. 15, 183–188). Over the years, a variety of models have been developed for predicting the growth and yield of uneven-aged stands using both individual and stand-level approaches. Modeling methodology not only has moved from an empirical approach to a more ecological process-based mechanistic approach, but also has incorporated a variety of techniques, such as, (1) systems of equations, (2) nonlinear stand table projections, (3) Markov chains, (4) matrix models, and (5) artificial neural network models. However, modeling the growth and yield of uneven-aged stands has received much less attention than that of even-aged stands. This paper reviews the current literature regarding growth and yield models for uneven-aged stands, discusses basic types of models and their merits, and reports recent progress in modeling the growth and dynamics of uneven-aged stands. Furthermore, future trends involving integration of new computer technologies (object-oriented programming and user-friendly interfaces), tree visualization techniques, and the spatially explicit application of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) into uneven-aged modeling strategies are discussed.},

	abstract = {Long-term scenarios play an important role in research on global environmental change. The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the SSP narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.},

Application of SDI in uneven-aged stands has been described mathematically but not justified biologically. Diameter-class trends in SDI and sapwood area across 14 uneven-aged ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. \& C. Laws.) stands in eastern Montana were examined to elucidate the biological underpinnings of the SDI summation method. Results indicate that the SDI summation method is biased in its apportionment of relative stand density across diameter classes in uneven-aged ponderosa pine stands. SDI apportions greater relative density to small trees than to larger ones. Therefore, SDI may overpredict site occupancy for reverse J-shaped diameter distributions with more small trees than large ones, and it may underpredict occupancy with nonreverse J-shaped diameter distributions. Application of the SDI summation method in uneven-aged ponderosa pine stands may be biologically justified only if site occupancy – diameter-class trends are taken into account when interpreting SDI values. Replacing the self-thinning scaling factor of the SDI summation method with more biologically relevant scaling relationships may create improved relative density measures for uneven-aged stands.},

A comparison to a ‘business as usual’ management approach (i.e. age-class scenario) was also made. Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)

The age-class scenario, on the other hand, showed peaks and drops in the timber volume.The land expectation values at the end of transformation were higher (i = 1 or 2 per cent) or equal (i = 3 per cent) to those of the age-class scenario for the younger stand. The transformation of younger forests appears to be economically interesting (under interest rates above 2 per cent) as the early revenues of more intensive thinnings achieve an equilibrium growing stock well below the potential maximum growing stock of an even-aged stand. This suggests transformation management to be economically efficient under the given silvicultural and economic conditions. The transformation of mature stands was found to be less economically viable due to the lower holding values for the transformation (uneven-aged) scenario compared with the age-class scenario. However, the holding values of the younger stand were higher for all interest rates compared with the age-class scenario.This study concludes that transformation (uneven-aged) scenario yielded more economically viable silvicultural approach (in the case of younger forests) and a steadier trend in harvested and remaining timber volume showing no major fluctuations.

	abstract = {Transformation from even-aged to uneven-aged forest management is currently taking place throughout Europe. Climate change is, however, expected to change growth conditions—possibly quite radically. Using a deterministic approach, it was the objective of this study to investigate the influence of such changes on optimal transformation strategies for an even-aged stand of European Beech in Denmark. For a range of growth change scenarios, represented by changes in site index, optimal harvest policies were determined using a matrix modelling approach and a differential evolution algorithm. Transition probabilities were updated continuously based on stand level variables and the transition matrix was thus dynamic. With optimal transformation policies, stand development followed similar pathways during the transformation phase irrespective of climate change scenario. Optimal transformation policies were thus robust, suggesting that a good policy would work well under different outcomes of climate change, i.e., acting under erroneous assumptions about change would not lead to major economic loss. For the chosen case stand, the net present value (NPV) of the transformation phase (first 100 years) contributed 80–90 \% of the total expectation value at a 2 \% discount rate. To assess the robustness of the optimisation procedure and understand the nature of the response surface, 100 replications per scenario were carried out. Variation between replications peaked during the later stages of the transformation phase indicating several pathways for transformation, which were characterised by almost identical levels of profitability.},

The Trial Area was established in 1952 when most of the plantations were 20–30 years old. The 117-ha area was divided into six Blocks and the plan was to transform the area over a 60-year period by felling and regenerating groups totalling 2 ha in each Block every 6 years. The objectives of this paper are (1) to examine the design, implementation and monitoring of the process of transformation and (2) to investigate if the data collected can be used to quantify the progress of transformation to an irregular structure. The Trial Area has been driven by a clear objective but unfortunately the management plan has not been revised and there has not been a consistent approach to record keeping. This has made it difficult to relate management interventions to the development of the forest structure. An earlier analysis claimed that transformation was almost complete; this was based on a comparison of diameter distributions of the 1990 data with an exponential regression. However, the analysis in this paper includes all the data collected between 1952 and 1990 and shows that the diameter distribution of all Blocks has been similar to an exponential since the start of the Trial. The main reason for this is that the monitoring unit has been the Block, and a spatial scale of ∼20 hectares is probably too coarse to detect the changes that are clear in aerial photographs.},

Transformation of the stand, located in Faskally Forest, Scotland, began over 60 years ago and it is now managed under the selection system. The aim was to determine whether a sustainable irregular state has been reached based on a stable diameter distribution, basal area and stand increment and on whether sufficient regeneration of the desired species and recruitment into the canopy is present to maintain the distribution. Complete inventories at 6-year intervals were carried out in a 1-ha permanent sample plot established in 1997. Results from the 2009 inventory suggest that the stand has not reached a sustainable irregular condition based on the above criteria. A reduction in canopy tree number in the last harvesting intervention has slightly flattened the diameter distribution (q = 1.4 cf. 1.5 and 1.6 in 2003 and 1997 inventories, respectively). The reduction in overhead cover has increased the number of regenerating seedlings in the understorey and suggests that the stand is moving towards a more balanced structure. Shade-tolerant western hemlock and beech dominate the understorey followed by semi-shade-tolerant Douglas-fir and Norway spruce. Recommendations for future management are discussed.},

	abstract = {Mulching is frequently used to reduce runoff and erosion following high-severity wildfires. In commercial forest stands, post-fire salvage logging is common practice, although it can lead to increased erosion losses in recently burned areas. Field research concerning the effects of post-fire salvage logging on sediment production is limited and the effects of clearcutting in areas previously treated by mulching are not known. In this study, 36 experimental plots were established in three experimental sites affected by crown fires that caused moderate-high soil burn severity in the summer of 2013. Immediately after the fire, bark strands mulch was applied in 18 of the plots. Salvage logging took place at the end of the first winter following fire. Post logging treatments were: mulching+salvage logging, no mulching+salvage logging and no mulching+no logging. The objectives of the study were to determine whether mulching mitigates soil erosion caused by fire and salvage logging and also to assess the possible effects of wildfire and salvage logging, with and without mulching, on vegetation recovery. During the six month period lapsed between the wildfire and salvage logging, precipitation was higher than the annual mean in the area, and the average soil loss in the untreated burned soils was 18.5Mgha−1. In that period, mulching significantly reduced soil loss (84\%). In the 18-month period following salvage logging and in the absence of mulch, there was no increase in erosion due to logging (8.7Mgha−1) compared with the unlogged treatment (7.0Mgha−1) whereas mulching reduced significantly soil losses even after logging (2.3Mgha−1). Neither mulching nor salvage logging had any detrimental effects on the regeneration of natural vegetation. Our results showed that the mulching just after a fire can substantially reduce the subsequent erosion due to post-fire salvage logging without any significant adverse effects on vegetative regrowth. In addition, leaving the standing burned trees seemed not to be a feasible management option to reduce post-fire erosion and enhance vegetation recovery in those kind of stands.},

	abstract = {The sustainability of shade-intermediate tree species such as Douglas fir in complex forest structures (with more than two distinct storeys) has been controversially discussed for a long time and traditionally shade-tolerant tree species have been preferred in plenter forest management. The most critical question in this context is whether recruitment trees of a particular species can survive in the shady conditions of the understorey and whether they can contribute to a demographic continuity. Using data from the unique, replicated monitoring site Artist’s Wood in North Wales (UK) we investigated the recruitment dynamics of Douglas fir to address the question whether this species can grow in complex forest structures on a long-term basis. Then we compared the results with those from Norway spruce and silver fir plenter forests in the Swiss Jura. Demographic continuity in complex structures is ensured if all forest development stages are represented in appropriate demographic proportions. We quantified these development stages in terms of stem diameter classes and analysed the corresponding diameter growth, competition and the loss of trees due to mortality and forest management. Based on this analysis we determined demographic equilibrium conditions for Artist’s Wood. The results confirmed that Douglas fir at Artist’s Wood can indeed grow sustainably in complex forest structures at a stand density of 27.4m2 ha−1 basal area which corresponds to a standing volume of 342m3 ha−1. However, equilibrium conditions for Douglas fir can only be achieved at the expense of a lower overall stand density of approximately 85\% of that of Norway spruce. Despite this the corresponding Douglas fir stand volume increment of 15.3m3 ha−1 year−1 is greater than that of Norway spruce. Thus Douglas fir plenter forests are not only possible but are also appealing considering the broad site amplitude of the species in conjunction with ongoing climate change and the potential of the species for CO2 retention.},

	abstract = {Past failures of monocultures, caused by wind-throw or insect damages, and ongoing climate change currently strongly stimulate research into mixed-species stands. So far, the focus has mainly been on combinations of species with obvious complementary functional traits. However, for any generalization, a broad overview of the mixing reactions of functionally different tree species in different mixing proportions, patterns and under different site conditions is needed, including assemblages of species with rather similar demands on resources such as light. Here, we studied the growth of Scots pine and oak in mixed versus monospecific stands on 36 triplets located along a productivity gradient across Europe, reaching from Sweden to Spain and from France to Georgia. The set-up represents a wide variation in precipitation (456–1250 mm year−1), mean annual temperature (6.7–11.5 °C) and drought index by de Martonne (21–63 mm °C−1). Stand inventories and increment cores of trees stemming from 40- to 132-year-old, fully stocked stands on 0.04–0.94-ha-sized plots provided insight into how species mixing modifies stand growth and structure compared with neighbouring monospecific stands. On average, the standing stem volume was 436 and 360 m3 ha−1 in the monocultures of Scots pine and oak, respectively, and 418 m3 ha−1 in the mixed stands. The corresponding periodical annual volume increment amounted to 10.5 and 9.1 m3 ha−1 year−1 in the monocultures and 10.5 m3 ha−1 year−1 in the mixed stands. Scots pine showed a 10\% larger quadratic mean diameter (p {\textless} 0.05), a 7\% larger dominant diameter (p {\textless} 0.01) and a 9\% higher growth of basal area and volume in mixed stands compared with neighbouring monocultures. For Scots pine, the productivity advantages of growing in mixture increased with site index (p {\textless} 0.01) and water supply (p {\textless} 0.01), while for oak they decreased with site index (p {\textless} 0.01). In total, the superior productivity of mixed stands compared to monocultures increased with water supply (p {\textless} 0.10). Based on 7843 measured crowns, we found that in mixture both species, but especially oak, had significantly wider crowns (p {\textless} 0.001) than in monocultures. On average, we found relatively small effects of species mixing on stand growth and structure. Scots pine benefiting on rich, and oak on poor sites, allows for a mixture that is productive and most likely climate resistant all along a wide ecological gradient. We discuss the potential of this mixture in view of climate change.},

	abstract = {European beech is the dominant native tree species in sub-mountain and mountain zones of the European continent and provides multiple ecosystem services to European society. However, the mountain zone is strongly affected by environmental change. Here, we explore the long-term natural dynamics of European beech-dominated old-growth forests in the Western Carpathians, Central Europe. We use fifty-year measurements of forest stand dynamics from eleven nature reserves strictly protected from any management (some of them included in the UNESCO natural heritage program). The study sites cover a typical range of natural conditions of the beech-dominated altitudinal zone in the Western Carpathians. The database includes long-term pair-wise non-destructive measurements of nearly 3.000 beeches from 1970 through 2019. We aim to investigate three crucial processes of beech forest dynamics: increment, ingrowth, and mortality of beech trees. The results, besides expected interactions, indicated a statistically significant change in radial increment and tree mortality during the study period. The radial increment increased, whereas tree mortality decreased during the past decades. Our findings indicate that European beech has strengthened the role of the most vital and competitive tree species in the elevational range from sub-mountain to mountain zone of Central European mountains during the last 50 years. The species increases the potential of enlarging its current distribution and outcompeting other species at the upper as well as lower elevational range edges. The assumed reasons for such development considering postglacial vegetation development in Europe and upcoming climate change are discussed. Possible implications and ways how to utilize the observed findings in close-to-nature forest management are suggested.},
